# PlanetBrokerTycoon
Prototype of a game, where you must balance the finances and the ecology of your energy production business.

## How to play
In this game, you must buy building and place them on the tiles of your map to generate profit.

But watch out! Beside your funds, you have to also manage the resources of each tile as well as the overall ecosystem while still generating enough profit.

Click on the icon of a building to purchase one then drag-and-drop it on an available tile. The building will then extract the resources of its tile to generate money.

Different building have different effects, be sure to read their information by hovering above them.

Should the Financial Pressure be out of control or the Ecological Integrity ruined, that's game over for you.
